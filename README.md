## Description
An example of a slideshow gallery created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The slideshow plays automatically and goes through each slide in the slideshow array.  When the slideshow reaches the end of the array it starts back at the first picture.  Whe the user clicks on the play pause button the icon changes, the slideshow pauses, and left and right arrows appear.  The left and right arrows also appear when the user hovers the cursor on the left or right side of the screen. When the user clicks on the left or right arrow the slideshow pauses and the slide goes to either the last slide shown or the next slide in the array depending on which arrow is clicked.  When the user clicks on the play-pause icon again if the slideshow has been stopped, the slideshow resumes and the left and right arrows disappear.
